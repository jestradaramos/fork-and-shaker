## Backend

The backend is a Go server built with Gorilla Mux. For more details, see the [backend README](backend/README.md).

## Frontend

The frontend will be implemented in the `frontend/` directory. Stay tuned for updates.

## Development

To run the full application:

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
```

2. Start the frontend application (once implemented):
```bash
cd frontend
# Frontend start command will be added later
```
